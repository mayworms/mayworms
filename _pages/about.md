Hi, I'm Samuel! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Research Associate and incoming PhD student working with <a href="https://oliverhaimson.com/index.html">Dr. Oliver L. Haimson</a> and his Community Research on Identity and Technology (CRIT) Lab at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu">University of Michigan School of Information</a> (UMSI). I will begin my PhD in Information at UMSI in Fall '24. 

Some of my current research interests include trans-specific online communities, content moderation, folk theorization, alternative online infrastructures, platform governance, and digital preservation. 

I graduated from UMSI with a Master of Information in May 2022. Prior to my graduate program, I worked in public and academic libraries.
