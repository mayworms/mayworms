Hi, I'm Samuel! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a first year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu">University of Michigan School of Information</a> (UMSI), advised by <a href="https://oliverhaimson.com/index.html">Dr. Oliver L. Haimson</a> and <a href="https://michaelannethomas.com">Dr. Michaelanne Thomas</a>. 

Some of my current research interests include trans-centered online communities, content moderation, platform governance, folk theorization, and alternative online infrastructures. 

I graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Relations and Policy in 2017, and from UMSI with a Master of Information in May 2022. Prior to my graduate program, I worked in public and academic libraries.
