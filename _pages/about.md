Hi, I'm Samuel! ðŸ‘‹ 

My pronouns are he/him/his. I graduated from the University of Michigan School of Information with a Master of Information (concentration in Digital Archives, Library Science, and Preservation) in May 2022. Some of my current research interests include digital preservation, digital literacy, the relationship between content moderation and marginalized social media user communities, and marginalization and digital self-representation. I received my BA in Social Relations and Policy from James Madison College at Michigan State University. Prior to my graduate program, I worked in both public and academic libraries.
