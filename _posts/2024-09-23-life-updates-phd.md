In the past month, I:

- **began my PhD in Information at UMSI**, advised by Dr. Oliver L. Haimson and Dr. Michaelanne Thomas
- attended the **2nd International Trans Studies Conference** at Northwestern University
- **returned to my research** (after a brief break during my first week of classes -- needed time to remember how to be a student again lol)
- started **rewriting my website**

How do I feel? Exhilirated, exhausted, driven, hopeful, and deeply grateful. The opportunity to pursue my research interests while continuing my academic career is an extraordinary privilege -- I hope to make the most of it.

Regarding my website: my goal is for the mayworms.info overhaul to go live by the end of September (a little over a week from now!). I enjoyed using this Jekyll template for a while, but chose to rewrite my website in [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and to redesign the CSS on my own rather than using a template (being stuck with someone else's design choices is no fun!). Here's hoping that the website overhaul turns out well üôè
